# 🛠️ Product Image Carousel – Meliotech Talent Challenge

This project is a simple but interactive product image management component built with **React.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Express.js** for a mock server. It was developed as part of the Meliotech Talent Challenge.

---

## ✨ Features

- Upload **multiple product images** at once
- Preview images **before submission**
- Remove individual images in preview mode
- View uploaded images in a **React Slick** carousel
- Edit **product details** like name, description, category, price, and SKU
- Clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI
- Simple Express.js server used to simulate submission (optional)

---

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Carousel:** [React Slick](https://react-slick.neostack.com/)
- **State Management:** `useState` (lightweight and local)
- **Backend (mock):** Node.js with Express.js (no database)

---

## 🧠 Design Considerations

- The goal was to simulate a product editing screen, as might be found in an ERP or inventory management system.
- Priority was given to keeping the UI intuitive and the logic simple to follow.
- `useState` was chosen for state management to avoid overcomplicating with Context API or tools like React Query.
- The carousel is only displayed once images are uploaded and ready to preview.
- Tailwind CSS ensures responsive styling with a clean and modern look.
